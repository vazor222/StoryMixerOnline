			<h3>How to Play</h3>
			<p>Once you join a party, you will make a character together with everyone else. First you will be asked to come up with a trait for your character. It can be something about how they look, a strength, something they like, a personality trait, or whatever you like. It should be interesting and help your character stand out. Everyone will vote for the best character and their story at the end.</p>
			<p>Next, you will define a trait for someone else's character. It can be nice and play off their trait so far, or it can be something difficult or funny that will make it challenging for them to come up with interesting story.</p>
			<p>Then, you come up with an event (obstacle, goal, person, interaction, scene) for another player to try to make an interesting reaction/story from. Then you will be shown the event you were given, and you will be asked to write an interesting or amusing story about what your character does in reaction to that event. Make it entertaining or awesome and you might just get enough votes to win the game!</p>
			<p>Finally, everyone's characters and stories will be displayed, and then players will have a chance to vote for their favorite (other than themselves). The player with the most votes wins the game!</p>
